# Autonomous Robot
The Autonomous Obstacle-Avoidance Robot is a custom-built robotic system engineered to navigate autonomously within a designated space while circumventing obstacles encountered along its path
It employs a Raspberry Pi microcontroller as its central processing unit, programmed to execute sensor data processing and control the robot's movements in real-time. By integrating sensors such as ultrasonic or infrared proximity sensors, the robot can detect obstacles in its vicinity and adjust its trajectory accordingly to evade collisions.

This project encapsulates a comprehensive exploration of robotics, encompassing various disciplines including hardware design, sensor interfacing, and software development. Through hands-on experience in constructing the robot chassis, assembling electronic components, and writing code for sensor integration and control algorithms, valuable practical skills in robotics engineering and hardware-software integration were acquired. Ultimately, the project demonstrates proficiency in the design and implementation of autonomous systems, laying the foundation for further exploration and innovation in the field of robotics.
